    abstract = {This comprehensive textbook presents a clean and coherent account of most fundamental tools and techniques in Parameterized Algorithms and is a self-contained guide to the area. The book covers many of the recent developments of the field, including application of important separators, branching based on linear programming, Cut &amp; Count to obtain faster algorithms on tree decompositions, algorithms based on representative families of matroids, and use of the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. A number of older results are revisited and explained in a modern and didactic way. The book provides a toolbox of algorithmic techniques. Part I is an overview of basic techniques, each chapter discussing a certain algorithmic paradigm. The material covered in this part can be used for an introductory course on fixed-parameter tractability. Part II discusses more advanced and specialized algorithmic ideas, bringing the reader to the cutting edge of current research. Part III presents complexity results and lower bounds, giving negative evidence by way of W[1]-hardness, the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and kernelization lower bounds. All the results and concepts are introduced at a level accessible to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. Every chapter is accompanied by exercises, many with hints, while the bibliographic notes point to original publications and related work.}

    abstract = { The authors give a short proof of a theorem of Lipton and Tarjan, that, for every planar graph with \$n > 0\$ vertices, there is a partition \$( A,B,C )\$ of its vertex set such that \$|A|,|B| < \frac{2}{3}n,|C| \leq 2( 2n )^{1/2} \$, and no vertex in A is adjacent to any vertex in B Secondly, they apply the same technique more carefully to deduce that, in fact, such a partition \$( A,B,C )\$ exists with \$|A|,|B| < \frac{2}{3}n\$, and \$|C| \leq \frac{3}{2}( 2n )^{1/2} \$ ; this improves the best previously known result. An analogous result holds when the vertices or edges are weighted. }

  abstract = {A module of an undirected graph is a set X of nodes such for each node x not in X, either every member of X is adjacent to x, or no member of X is adjacent to x. There is a canonical linear-space representation for the modules of a graph, called the modular decomposition. Closely related to modular decomposition is the transitive orientation problem, which is the problem of assigning a direction to each edge of a graph so that the resulting digraph is transitive. A graph is a comparability graph if such an assignment is possible. We give O(n + m) algorithms for modular decomposition and transitive orientation, where n and m are the number of vertices and edges of the graph. This gives linear time bounds for recognizing permutation graphs, maximum clique and minimum vertex coloring on comparability graphs, and other combinatorial problems on comparability graphs and their complements.}
